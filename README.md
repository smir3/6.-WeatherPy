Purpose of this analysis

Plan my trip is a top travel technology company which specializes in internet related services in the hotel and lodging industry. In this analysis, I am tasked with collecting and analyzing weather data across cities worldwide and presenting the data to PlanMyTrip customers via the search page. The customers will then filter the data on the search page based on their weather preferences and preferred travel criteria in order to find their ideal hotel anywhere in the world. The weather data will be added to a pandas dataframe where I will create a series of scatterplots to show the relationship between latitude and a variety of weather parameters for over 500 cities around the world. The data will also be presented in the form of heatmaps with pop-up markers that can display information on specific cities based on a customer's travel preferences.
