Plan my trip is a top travel technology company, specializes in internet related services in the hotel and lodging industry. Jack is the head of analysis for the user interface team. He has asked you to help him collect and present data to customers via the search page which they will then filter based on their preferred travel criteria, in order to find their ideal hotel anywhere in the world. To perform this task you will be using the jupyter notebook in the city py module to get the cities for more than 500 random latitudes and longitudes, then you will perform request on the open weather api and retrieve the weather data from these cities. The weather data will be added to a pandas dataframe where you will use matplotlib to create a series of scatterplots to show the relationship between latitude and a variety of weather parameters for over 500 cities around the world. As part of the analysis will need to perform statistical analysis on the data using linear regression on the weather paramters in the northern and southerm hemispheres. This data will help the team predict the best time of year for people to plan their vacation. Finally will export the data, clean it, and use the weather data to choose the best cities for vacation based on certain weather criteria. And map these cities using jupyter g maps, nad google places API. Help travellers find their ideal vacation spot.
